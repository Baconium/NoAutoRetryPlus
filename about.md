NoAutoRetry+ makes disabling the 'Auto Retry' option in game less janky, fixing a couple of bugs/inconsistencies.

Features:

- Using the up key to retry a level, just like the spacebar does
- Makes the "death screen" pop up in practice mode
- Fixes the bug that allows for multiple death screens to appear

These are all toggleable if you don't like a specific feature. (Personally, I believe that all of these should be how the game functions in vanilla.)
