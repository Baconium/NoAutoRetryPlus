## v1.1.0 - 1/7/26

* New feature: Instant retry. makes it so clicking retry activates on mouse down rather than mouse up. useful for levels like low death that make you click on frame one.
* Fixed an issue with the "Click anywhere to retry" option that made it so hitting the menu button wouldn't do anything (you can now safely use it on mobile as well.)
* Up arrow retry now functions with the level complete screen
* Updated the mod icon
* Removed Herobrine

## v1.0.4 - 12/29/25

* New feature: Click anywhere to retry. allows you to click anywhere on screen to retry rather than just the retry button (do not use this feature on mobile)
* Reformatted changelog to put the latest update at the top
* Removed Herobrine

## v1.0.3 - 12/15/25

* Makes the up arrow able to do everything the spacebar can do in game, such as starting levels (tied to the "Up arrow retry" option)

## v1.0.2 - 12/8/25

* Initial release (v1.0.0 and v1.0.1 weren't accepted to the mod index)
* Mod works on all platforms instead of just windows
