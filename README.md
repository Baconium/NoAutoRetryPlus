NoAutoRetry+ is a mod for Geometry Dash using Geode. It pretty much just makes disabling the 'Auto Retry' option in game less janky, fixing a couple of bugs/inconsistencies.

Features:

* Using the up key to retry a level, just like the spacebar does
* Makes the "death screen" pop up in practice mode
* Fixes the bug that allows for multiple death screens to appear (usually only occurs when switching start positions)

These are all toggleable in game if you don't like a specific feature. Personally, I believe that all of these should be how the game functions in vanilla.

Installation:

download the .geode mod from the latest release, then put it in your mods folder. not sure if the mod works on mobile, it *probably* works on macos.
(note, the mod is not currently on the geode index, I'm gonna submit it for review after writing this readme)
