NoAutoRetry+ is a mod for Geometry Dash using Geode. It pretty much just makes disabling the 'Auto Retry' option in game less janky, fixing a couple of bugs/inconsistencies.

Features:

* Using the up key to retry a level, just like the spacebar does
* Makes the "death screen" pop up in practice mode
* Fixes the bug that allows for multiple death screens to appear (usually only occurs when switching start positions)

These are all toggleable in game if you don't like a specific feature. Personally, I believe that all of these should be how the game functions in vanilla.

Installation:

the mod is on the geode index! you can download it in game through the mod browser. if you would like to install it manually, just download the mod from the latest release and put it in your mods folder.
